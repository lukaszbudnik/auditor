# Auditor [![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/lukaszbudnik/auditor.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/lukaszbudnik/auditor)

Auditor records audit entries in a blockchain backed by DynamoDB and CosmosDB (using MongoDB API).

This is a work in progress.

# REST API

```
curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"Timestamp\": \"2019-01-01T12:39:01.999999999+01:00\", \"Event\": \"something new\"}" http://localhost:8080/audit
```

# Executing tests

In order to execute tests you need to setup local MongoDB and DynamoDB containers.
There is a `docker-compose.yml` available for your convenience:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
$ ./coverage.sh
$ docker-compose down
```
