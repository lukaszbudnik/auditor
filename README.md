# Auditor [![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/lukaszbudnik/auditor.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/lukaszbudnik/auditor)

Auditor records audit entries in a blockchain backed by AWS DynamoDB and Azure CosmosDB (MongoDB API).

This is a work in progress.

# Blockchain

Auditor uses simple blockchain implementation on top of AWS DynamoDB and Azure CosmosDB (MongoDB API). The `store.Store` looks like this:

```
type Store interface {
	Save(block interface{}) error
	Read(result interface{}, limit int64, last interface{}) error
	Close()
}
```

The interface is generic and operates on well known `interface{}` constructs.

## MongoDB

For MongoDB a simple block struct could look like this:

```
type Block struct {
	Timestamp    *time.Time `auditor:"mongodb_range,mongodb_index" validate:"nonzero"`
	Category     string     `auditor:"mongodb_index"`
	Event        string     `validate:"nonzero"`
	Hash         string     `auditor:"hash"`
	PreviousHash string     `auditor:"previoushash"`
}
```

Such struct has:

* [required] string field tagged with `auditor:"hash"` - used for storing block hash
* [required] string field tagged with `auditor:"previoushash"` - used for storing previous block hash
* [required] time field tagged with `auditor:"mongodb_range"` - used for viewing/paging blocks
* [optional] any field can have `mongodb_index` added to auditor tag for example `auditor:"mongodb_range,mongodb_index"` - used for ensuring collection indexes
* [optional] if you want to have access to native `_id` column add field: `` ID bson.ObjectId bson:"_id,omitempty"` ``

MongoDB implementation works like this:

* `Save(block interface{})` - accepts a pointer to struct and saves it in MongoDB, before saving computes hash and sets previous hash values, also ensures that all relevant indexes are created
* `Read(result interface{}, limit int64, last interface{})` - reads blocks from MongoDB and copies them to `result` which is a pointer to slice of structs, `limit` specifies how many records to read, `last` is an optional argument, when not nil must be a pointer to struct of the same type as `result`, `last` is used for paging, the field tagged with `auditor: "mongodb_range"` is used in MongoDB's query `{field: {$lt: value} }`, results are sorted by the field tagged with `auditor: "mongodb_range"` in descending order `{$sort: {field: -1}}`

For usage see test: `store/mongodb/mongodb_test.go`.

## DynamoDB

# REST API

```
curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"Timestamp\": \"2019-01-01T12:39:01.999999999+01:00\", \"Event\": \"something new\"}" http://localhost:8080/audit
```

# Executing tests

In order to execute tests you need to setup local MongoDB and DynamoDB containers.
There is a `docker-compose.yml` available for your convenience:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
$ ./coverage.sh
$ docker-compose down
```
